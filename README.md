## About the project
The objectives of the project are:
- Define a REST API using the swagger language;
- Write user stories as Github issues;
- Implement a NodeJS server in a CI environment;

The API should enable professors and teacher assistants to create assignments with tasks. Students are grouped in user groups and tasks of assignments are drawn from task pools. When students have completed their assignments, they peer-review answers of other students.
